# Tungdv_C_Lib
This is my own library for Data structure and Algorithm
Language: C

# Usage
1. After clone this repository, jump into directory Algorithm by "cd Algorithm"
2. Then type: "make" 
3. "cd .."
4. "make"
5. "./test"

# Helpful information
By typing make, you will run the default command in "makefile". For library, ex: Algorithm, make will build a library *.a,
copy to Implementation and copy the header files to Header.
In the root directory, make will compile test.c with all including library into an executable file test.
